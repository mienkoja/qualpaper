macro:->Students
of
social
welfare
may
initially
be
taken
back
by
the
use
of
economic
models
to
understand
the
phenomenon
of
child
maltreatment.
Historically,
social
welfare
scholars
and
other
non-economic
social
scientists
have
tended
to
approach
theory
development
as
a
means
of
organizing
broad
constructs
or
ideas
to
explain
experimental
or
survey
data
sources.
Economists,
on
the
the
other
hand,
have
tended
to
view
theory
development
as
a
process
analogous
to
theory
development
in
the
physical
sciences.
As
such,
in
much
the
same
way
that
an
astrophysicist
seeks
to
explain
the
motion
of
the
planets
through
mathematical
equations,
economists
have
tended
to
rely
on
a
large
body
of
established
mathematical
theory
in
order
to
explain
interactions
between
humans.
While
the
current
manuscript
will
not
rely
heavily
on
formal
mathematical
theory,
effort
is
made
throughout
this
manuscript
to
demonstrate
how
the
conclusions
and
major
concepts
of
economic
theory
are
still
relevant
and
applicable
to
the
current
problem.

macro:->Some
have
argued
that
descriptions
such
as
those
made
by
Chagnon
are
overly
simplistic
and
that
parents
who
had
apparently
abandoned
their
children
actually
made
efforts
to
remain
involved
in
the
lives
of
their
children.
(e.g.
Murdoch,
2006).
However,
evidence
of
parents
attempts
to
remain
connected
and
involved
in
spite
of
resource
constraints
does
not
contradict
the
argument
made
here.
All
that
is
being
stated
in
this
model
is
that
such
efforts
will
always
be
more
difficult
for
parents
operating
under
resource
constraints.

macro:->Here,
the
word
``maltreative''
is
used,
as
an
adjective
describing
care
which
is
characterized
by
violence
or
neglect
without
regard
to
malice.
Such
an
adjective
is
important
for
the
framework
presented
in
this
manuscript
in
order
to
avoid
categorization
of
behaviors
by
way
of
adjectives
such
as
``abusive''
or
``neglectful''
while
also
avoiding
the
inherent
presence
of
malice
in
the
use
of
an
adjective
such
as
``malicious''.
While
other
candidate
adjectives
exist
(e.g.
\emph
{laesive}
from
the
Latin
adjective
\emph
{laesus}
meaning
injured),
``maltreative''
is
chosen
due
to
the
relative
semantic
comfort
that
most
of
this
manuscript's
probable
readership
will
find
with
this
word.

macro:->To
be
clear,
the
author
is
explicitly
agnostic
about
\emph

The

is

that
they
\emph
{do}
make
such
decisions.
\@endanenote

macro:->While
the
studies
cited
here
vary
in
what
they
consider
to
be
``serious''
maltreatment,
the
definitions
are
similar
and
generally
indicate
an
instance
of
maltreatment
in
which
medical
attention
was
required.

macro:->There
are,
of
course,
differences
between
the
Canadian
and
US
child
protection
systems.
However,
there
are
inherent
cultural
similarities
between
the
two
countries
as
well
as
a
common
lineage
in
Elizabethan
Poor
Law
and
progressive
era
children's
societies.
Furthermore,
the
overall
incidence
of
child
maltreatment
in
Canada
is
similar
to
that
of
the
US.
For
instance,
the
2008
incidence
of
child
maltreatment
in
the
US
was
10.3
per
1,000
children
in
the
population
US
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
(2013)
compared
with
a
rate
of
14.19
in
Canada
Trocm{Ã©}
et
al.
(2010).
While
a
difference
of
4.6
incidents
of
maltreatment
per
1,000
children
is
not
inconsequential,
we
can
reasonably
expect
the
proportion
of
serious
incidents
of
child
maltreatment
in
the
US
to
be
similar
to
that
of
Canada.

macro:->This
is

The

proposed

readily

children

multiple

to

human
wellbeing
is
not

a

it
is
more
generally
a

and
the
choices
that
individuals
make
throughout

Talking

macro:->In
addition
to
altruism,
Brandon
(2001)
developed
the
concept
of
parental
efficiency
in
various
childcaring
strategies.
The
concept
of
parental
efficiency
was
tested
in
analysis
related
to
this
manuscript
and
is
described
in
the
technical
appendix
to
this
manuscript.
Efficiency,
as
defined
in
these
analyses,
proved
to
have
no
significant
predictive
power
with
respect
to
parental
discipline
strategies.
While
parental
efficiency
may
have
bearing
on
future
analyses,
substantive
discussions
of
efficiency
are
excluded
from
this
manuscript
for
the
sake

macro:->This
paper
categorizes
behaviors
into
Type
I
and
Type
II
strategies.
From
a
strictly
behavioral
perspective,
``explaining''
strategies
would
be
considered
to
be
a
form
of
positive
discipline
(i.e.~a
Type
I)
strategy
similar
to
yelling
and
spanking;
the
parent
is
giving
instead
of
taking.
Nonetheless,
a
salient
argument
could
be
made
that
forcing
a
child
to
engaging
in
verbal
communication
removes
them
from
a
stimulus
and
is
thus
a
Type
II
strategy.
Given
the
potential
for
confusion,
the
last
question
is
removed
from
the
analysis
and
focus
is
instead
made
on
the
four
remaining
behaviors
which
clearly
fall
within
the
Type
I
and
Type
II
strategies.
In
cross-validation
analyses,
the
results
for
models
in
which
``explaining''
is
entered
into
the
model
as
a
Type
I
strategy,
a
Type
II
strategy,
or
excluded
are
nearly
identical.
