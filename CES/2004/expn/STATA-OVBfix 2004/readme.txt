Correction of VEHICYR on the 
2004 Consumer Expenditure Survey
Interview Microdata

January 28, 2010
Updated: January 10, 2014


These files contain the corrected Vehicle Year variable (VEHICYR) from the Interview OVB04 file.  
The original released Interview OVB file included incorrect codes for VEHICYR.  These files include the correct values for the variables. 

The corrected variables can be matched with the OVB file  records by the  consumer  unit   identification  code,  NEWID and expenditure
record identifiers SEQNO and ALCNO.  The files are named "ovb_update04.sas7bdat" for SAS and "ovb_update04.txt" for ASCII column-parametered.  
The variables included in the addendum files are listed below.

NAME           LENGTH   FORMAT
---------------------------------------
NEWID      	8       NUM(8.0)
SEQNO 		3	NUM(3.0)
ALCNO		3	NUM(3.0)
QYEAR		5	CHAR(5)
VEHICYR		2	CHAR(2)
