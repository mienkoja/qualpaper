\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
A relatively underdeveloped area of household economic literature concerns the manner in which the maltreatment of children is formally understood or modeled. This deficit is due, at least in part, to the general perception that child maltreatment is best conceptualized as an irrational or even pathological act. Such perceptions are well-documented by \citet{Nelson1986} who notes that modern conceptions of child maltreatment have been largely framed by the medical community which defines the problem of child maltreatment imprecisely in terms of social deviance and a defect in the character of parents who engage in maltreatment. The central thesis of this paper is that maltreatment can be conceptualized as the non-pathological consequence of parenting under resource constraints. While child maltreatment may be undesirable, in most cases it is not pathological. Recognition of this basic distinction has important implications for child welfare policy and practice.

The basic relationship between resources and child maltreatment is well-established in non-economic social science literature with previous studies establishing links between resource constraints and substantiated allegations of child maltreatment as well as general involvement with the child welfare system \citep{Gil1970, Pelton1981, Pelton1994, Russell1984, Sedlak1996, Stith2009, BergerAndWoldfogel2004}. Studies examining administrative data sets of low-income populations (e.g. TANF recipients) have also shown that exogenous resource-decreasing shocks such as welfare-reform \citep{Courtney2005} or welfare sanctions \citep{Slack2007} will tend to increase a family's probability of child welfare system involvement. Other studies have exploited experimental income support programs to address income endogeneity problems inherent in other studies and still find an inverse relationship between family income and the probability of child maltreatment \citep{Cancian2013, Fein2003}. While there is a paucity of research examining connections between income and child maltreatment outside of the US \citep{Cameron2006}, the evidence from the US seems to suggest a strong and reliable relationship between child welfare system involvement and resource levels.
